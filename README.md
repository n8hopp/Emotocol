# Emotocol

This repository is a prototype of Emotocol, a technology I designed that embodies the idea of "wearing your heart on your sleeve". The idea is that users would mix a set of colors, each representing a different "core" emotion, in order to make one "mix" color / display of some kind. This color would then show up on a Smart Pin or some other wearable so that you could communicate your mood without words. **The idea behind this is accessibility first and foremost.**
